# Space Invaders using Java

My attempt at making Space Invaders using Java. The player can be moved using the arrow keys or by using `wasd`. The player can shoot using `Enter` or by using `Space`. The game ends if you get hit. Press `Enter` or `Space` to restart. The game currently does not end if you kill all enemies. :warning: WIP

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+: Make sure you have the JDK installed.

### How to run

Run these commands:

```bash
javac -cp ./src ./src/main/Main.java -d ./bin
```
```bash
java -cp ./bin main.Main
```
